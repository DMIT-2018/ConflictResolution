# Conflict Resolution

This repository is an example of how to deal with merge conflicts.

Here is an example of a branch tree (similar to the current repository).

```
bug fix -                 .---o---o---o
                         /       /
dev     -           .---o---o---o---o---o
                   /
master  - .---o---o---o---o
```
